\arguments{
\item{left}{Data.frame containing the first set of loci.}

\item{right}{Data.frame containing the second set of loci.}

\item{left_chr_name}{Name of column containing chromosome.}

\item{left_start_name}{Name of column containing locus start position.}

\item{left_end_name}{Name of column containing locus end position.}

\item{right_chr_name}{Name of column containing chromosome.}

\item{right_start_name}{Name of column containing locus start position.}

\item{right_end_name}{Name of column containing locus end position.}
}
\value{
Data.frame.
}
\description{
Identifies which loci in \code{left} overlap with which loci in \code{right}.
Note this function is asymmetric; \code{FindOverlaps(left, right)} will
generally differ from \code{FindOverlaps(right, left)}.
