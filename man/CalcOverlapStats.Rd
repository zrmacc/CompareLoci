\arguments{
\item{left}{Data.frame containing the first set of loci.}

\item{right}{Data.frame containing the second set of loci.}

\item{left_chr_name}{Name of column containing chromosome.}

\item{left_start_name}{Name of column containing locus start position.}

\item{left_end_name}{Name of column containing locus end position.}

\item{right_chr_name}{Name of column containing chromosome.}

\item{right_start_name}{Name of column containing locus start position.}

\value{
Data.frame.

\description{
Calculates overlap statistics comparing loci on the \code{left} with loci on
the \code{right}. Note this function is asymmetric;
\code{CalcOverlapStats(left, right)} will generally differ from
\code{CalcOverlapStats(right, left)}.
